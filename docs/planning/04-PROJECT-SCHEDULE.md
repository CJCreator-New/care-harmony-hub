## Critical Path

```
Foundation → Automation → Intelligence → Optimization
    ↓            ↓            ↓              ↓
Mobile UI → AI Triage → ML Models → Performance
    ↓            ↓            ↓              ↓
Data Sync → Workflows → FHIR → Enterprise Scale
```

**Critical Dependencies**:
1. Mobile UI must complete before AI features
2. Data integration required for ML models
3. FHIR integration needed for interoperability
